## Business Problem section

**The business problem we are currently posing is:** *How can we avoid putting ourselves in danger while dinning out with the Covid-19 pandemic still going on?*

**Background infomation**
As Covid-19 is still out there, there's always a risk of dinning-in in restraurants, and statitically speaking, Americans eat out on an average of **5.9** times a week, which means that there's still a good amount of people that start going to restraurants sicne many states have moved on to phrase 3, which means that a lot of public places are back on business again. 

Although it is true that restraurants have been taking necesary procedures such as socially distanced table and putting focus on ventilation system/airflow, the risk of being affected still exists the moment you put yourself amoung other people. 

So how can we safely enjoy the time of eating out and not having to worry about the unecessary contacts with people? 	

**Audience**

This project mainly targets people that like going out to eat but also want to be in a worry-free environment in the top 4 states that have the most amount of covid-19 cases, however it also applies for other public facilities such as bars, playgrounds and other businesses where social distancing is not able to achieve.

## Data Section

For this project we need following data:

**Restaurants in each state**

*Data source*: Foursquare APIs

*Description* : By using this API we will get all the venues in each neighborhood. We can filter these venues to get only restaurants.
